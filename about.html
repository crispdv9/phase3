      <h1 >About </h1>
      <h2 id="rectangle2">The project </h2>
      <p>I SEE YOU is a project developed during the Final Sintesis Laboratory in Density Lab at the Politecnico di Milano.</p>
      <p>This project is an extension of protocol 3 from phase II, which highlighted- what the leaked security cameras are pointing at, on a website called Insecam.
I SEE YOU, showcases six different stories of leaked security camera footages found on Insecam, each from a different country. These act as starting point for revealing their vulnerability. It takes the audience through an informative and interactive journey of easily tracing the exact location, name and contact details of the owner of the camera. It further provides an opportunity to the audience to contact and inform the owner about their privacy being at risk. In the end the audience can also download a security manual to know basic tips to prevent data breach. </p>
      <h2 id="rectangle2">Aim </h2>
    <p>The aim is to inform the audience  that the security camera feed can be easily tracked through simple online tools in just a few clicks. </p>
      <h2 id="rectangle2">Focus </h2>
  <p>The project focuses on existing owners or potential owners of security cameras and people who are directly or indirectly under security camera vigilance. </p>
  <h2 id="rectangle2">Objective </h2>
  <p>The idea is to reflect the vulnerability of cameras that is often more pervasive than expected. People use cameras to feel safe, but paradoxically end up putting their privacy and security at risk.  </p>
  <h2 id="rectangle2">Design process </h2>
    <p> <b>Data Source-</b> <br>Insecam, is an online platform that shows leaked cameras from all around the world.
They are categorized by country, city, popularity or tags.</p>
<img class="pictures"src="images/oviedo.gif" style="width:600px;height:400px;">
<p><b>Tools Used-</b> <br>The entire research process has been carried out mannualy.</p>
<img class="pictures"src="images/oviedo.gif" style="width:600px;height:400px;">

<p><b>Visual Language-</b> <br>The digital language is reused in a very simple, real and raw manner that helps the audience to actually experience a real life situation. For example, exact shots are taken from websites like Google Maps and Trip Advisor. It provokes a feeling of taking proactive measures to prevent unauthorized access of security cameras. The combination of data, visual, text and interaction helps the audience to be more conscious about privacy concerns and acts as torchbearers to spread awareness. </p>
<img class="pictures"src="images/oviedo.gif" style="width:600px;height:400px;">
<p><b>Interactions-</b> <br>At various steps the audience is given the possibility to either keep going deeper in the data breach or to opt out. The idea is to actively involve and engage the audience while transmitting the idea of doing something “not allowed”. The audience is also given an option to interact with the owner of security camera and inform them about open access of the feed.  </p>
<img class="pictures"src="images/oviedo.gif" style="width:600px;height:400px;">
<p><b>Instruction Script-</b> <br>A predefined script is presented to make sure that the audience convey the precise message to the security camera owner. By doing this the message is reached and absorbed both by the audience and the owner.</p>
<img class="pictures"src="images/oviedo.gif" style="width:600px;height:400px;">
<p><b>Security manual-</b> <br>In order to further inform the audience, a security manual is provided which can be downloaded. The manual contains simple and general tips to protect their cameras. For example, putting a strong password or to not use the default password etc. These prevention measures if adapted can reduce the risk of data breach and personal security.</p>
<img class="pictures"src="images/oviedo.gif" style="width:600px;height:400px;">
<p ><b>Note-</b> During the process there are some details we decided to hide to respect people's privacy.</p>
